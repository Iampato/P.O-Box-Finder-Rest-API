# P.O-Box-Finder-Rest-API

A django rest Api for finding school,institution and offices p.o boxes 


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the awesome app.
- Just clone this repository by typing: `git clone https://github.com/Iampato/P.O-Box-Finder-Rest-API.git`
- Switch to project directory: `cd notable_django`
- Install project requirements using python pip. But wait, you have to have some stuff before you get to this point. So these are:

### Prerequisites

- Python3 and above
- Python virtual environment (not really, but is coming up)
Just type:
```
python -V
```
in your terminal and if its not greater than or equal to 3.5, you're not in big trouble, there are tons of tutorials to get up up and running with these. Just grub one then come back when done.

### Installing

Now, you have python3 and a way of running a virtual environment. Lets set up the project environment.

- Install the project requirements specified in the requirements.txt file. Usually,
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Deployment

No worry about deployment, you just run it on your console. As easy as:
```
python manage.py runserver
```
